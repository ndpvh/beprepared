\title{Distances to group centroid}
\usage{
distance_group_centroid(p_pred, centers, nped, fx = mean)
}
\arguments{
\item{p_pred}{Numeric matrix with shape N x 2 containing predicted positions
of all pedestrians that belong to the social group of the agent.}

\item{centers}{Numerical matrix containing the coordinates at each position
the object can be moved to. Should have one row for each cell.}

\item{nped}{Numeric integer indicating number of people in pedestrian `n`'s social group.}

\item{fx}{Function used to find the group centroid. Defaults to \code{mean}}
}
\value{
Numeric vector containing the distance from each cell in the `center`
to the group centroid. If not other agents belong to the same group as the 
agent, returns \code{NULL}.
}
\description{
Compute the distance of a given agent to the group centroid. This group 
centroid is computed as a summary statistic of the predicted x- and y-
coordinates of all pedestrians belonging to the same group as the agent. The 
summary statistic of choice should be one of mean-tendency, but can be 
specified by the user through the argument \code{fx}.
}
\details{
Note that this function has been defined to be in line with the \code{m4ma}
utility functions.
