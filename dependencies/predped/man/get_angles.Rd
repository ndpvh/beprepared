\title{Angle between agent and group members}
\usage{
get_angles(
  agent_idx,
  agent_group,
  position,
  orientation,
  p_pred,
  centers,
  any_member = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{agent_idx}{Numeric denoting the position of the agent in the prediction 
matrix \code{p_pred}.}

\item{agent_group}{Numeric vector with the group membership of all 
pedestrians.}

\item{position}{Numeric vector denoting the current position of the agent.}

\item{orientation}{Numeric denoting the current orientation of the agent.}

\item{p_pred}{Numeric matrix with shape N x 2 containing predicted positions
of all pedestrians that belong to the social group of the agent.}

\item{centers}{Numerical matrix containing the coordinates at each position
the object can be moved to. Should have one row for each cell.}

\item{any_member}{Logical denoting whether to consider the angles of all 
group members (\code{TRUE}) -- effectively saying that it doesn't matter 
which group member the agent can see, as long as they can see one -- or 
whether to only consider the nearest group member (\code{FALSE}). Defaults 
to \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
Numeric vector containing the relative angle of the group member(s)
compared to the orientation of the agent within a given cell in \code{centers}.
}
\description{
Finds the angle at which the group members are located compared to the agent.
Uses the predicted positions of the group members for this.
