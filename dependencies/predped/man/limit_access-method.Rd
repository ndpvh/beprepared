\title{Compute which segments can be crossed}
\usage{
limit_access(object, x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{Object of the \code{\link[predped]{background-class}}.}

\item{x}{Either a numeric vector or matrix containing x- and y-coordinates, 
or an object of the \code{\link[predped]{agent-class}}}
}
\value{
Logical vector or matrix denoting whether \code{segment}s can be 
passed through or not.
}
\description{
Method that determines whether one can cross the segments that are 
contained within the \code{limited_access} slot of the 
\code{\link[predped]{background-class}}. Determines this ability from the 
standpoint of \code{x}, which can either be a matrix of coordinates or an 
instance of the \code{\link[predped]{agent-class}}.
}
\details{
This method takes in an object of the \code{\link[predped]{background-class}}
and checks whether one can cross the \code{segment}s in the \code{limited_access}
slot from the standpoint taken in \code{x} (if \code{x} is a matrix) or from 
the position of \code{x} (if \code{x} is an \code{agent}).

Returns a Logical vector or matrix denoting which of the segments in the 
\code{limited_access} of the \code{background} object can be passed through 
from the standpoint of the the coordinates in \code{x} (\code{TRUE} means 
that the segment cannot be passed through while \code{FALSE} means that it 
can be passed through). With multiple coordinates and multiple segments, 
logicals are ordered with coordinates in the rows and segments in the columns.

If \code{limited_access} is an empty list, it returns an empty logical vector.
If a coordinate or agent is currently intersecting a segment, they are not 
blocked (i.e., then they receive the logical value \code{FALSE}).

# Create a setting where you can only cross the diagonal of the space if you
# are in the lower-right part of the space
my_background <- background(shape = rectangle(center = c(0, 0), 
                                              size = c(2, 2)), 
                            objects = list(), 
                            limited_access = list(segment(from = c(-1, -1),

# Create two agents of whom the access may be limited or not
agent_not_limited <- agent(center = c(0.75, -0.75), radius = 0.25)
agent_limited <- agent(center = c(-0.75, 0.75), radius = 0.25)

limit_access(my_background, agent_not_limited)
limit_access(my_background, agent_limited)

# Create a matrix of coordinates of which the first is not limited and the 
# second is
coords <- rbind(c(0.75, -0.75), c(-0.75, 0.75))
limit_access(my_background, coords)
