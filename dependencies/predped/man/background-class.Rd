\title{An S4 Class to Represent the Background}
\description{
Defines the \code{background} class, which contains all characteristics of 
the setting in which agents will be simulated to walk. Currently consists of 
the shape of the simulated room and objects that are contained within the 
room.

\section{Slots}{

\describe{
\item{\code{shape}}{Object of a type that extends \code{\link[predped]{object-class}}
defining the shape of the background. Importantly, the shape cannot be of 
the \code{\link[predped]{segment-class}}.}

\item{\code{objects}}{List of objects of a type that extends
\code{\link[predped]{object-class}} defining the objects that are present in 
the simulated room (e.g., tables and cabinets). Importantly, objects cannot 
be of the \code{\link[predped]{segment-class}}.}

\item{\code{limited_access}}{List of objects of the \code{\link[predped]{segment-class}}
which define the routes that can only be taken in one direction (see the 
documentation of \code{\link[predped]{segment-class}}).}

\item{\code{precomputed_segment_class}}{List of non-penetrable objects based on the 
values of slot \code{limited_access}. Is not meant to be changed by the user,
but is used as a slot to significantly speed up computations.}

\item{\code{entrance}}{Numeric matrix specifying the location(s) of the entrance(s), 
where the first column denotes the x-coordinate and the second column the 
y-coordinate.}

\item{\code{exit}}{Numeric matrix specifying the location(s) of the exit(s), 
where the first column denotes the x-coordinate and the second column the 
y-coordinate.}
