\title{Sample a Random Point on the Circumference}
\usage{
rng_point(object, middle_edge = TRUE)

\S4method{rng_point}{polygon}(object, middle_edge = TRUE)

\S4method{rng_point}{circle}(object, middle_edge = TRUE)

\S4method{rng_point}{segment}(object, middle_edge = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{Object of \code{\link[predped]{object-class}}.}

\item{middle_edge}{Logical denoting whether the point should lie in the middle
of a random edge. Ignored for circles. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{forbidden}{Numeric indicating where the random point cannot be drawn.
For \code{\link[predped]{polygon-class}} and 
\code{\link[predped]{rectangle-class}}, this is the edge number on which the 
point should not be generated. The edge number is determined through the 
\code{points} slot, where two coordinates create an edge. For 
\code{\link[predped]{circle-method}}, this is either a vector or a matrix of 
angles between which the point should not be sampled (in radians). For the 
latter, it is important to note that the intervals created by the angles 
should not overlap. Defaults to \code{NULL}, ensuring that a point can be 
sampled anywhere on the circumference of the object.}
}
\value{
Numerical vector denoting a coordinate on the circumference of the 
provided object.
}
\description{
Currently works for all instances of \code{\link[predped]{object-class}}.
}
\details{
Note that while \code{\link[predped]{rectangle-class}} is not explicitly 
mentioned here, this method does work for this class of objects.

Furthermore note that \code{forbidden} is ignored for the 
\code{\link[predped]{segment-class}}.
}
\examples{
# Create an object
my_circle <- circle(center = c(0, 0), radius = 1)

# Generate a point on the circumference of the circle without limitations
rng_point(my_circle)

# Generate a point on the circumference of the circle with limitations, so 
# that it cannot lie between the angles (0, pi/2) and (pi, 3 * pi/2), 
# meaning the coordinate cannot have both positive or both negative values 
# in its coordinates (one always has to be positive, the other negative).
rng_point(my_circle, 
          forbidden = rbind(c(0, pi/2), 
                            c(pi, 3 * pi/2)))
