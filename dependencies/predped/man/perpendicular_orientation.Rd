\usage{
perpendicular_orientation(object, co)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class object}

\item{co}{A vector of size 2 containing x and y coordinates for a location 
from which to deduce the perpendicular orientation}
}
\value{
Numeric denoting the perpendicular orientation to the entrance of the 
space in degrees
}
\description{
Finds the perpendicular or tangential orientation of a line starting from a

edge is chosen to be the entrance to the space. Is used to find in what
