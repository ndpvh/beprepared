\title{Continuous visual field utility}
\usage{
vf_utility_continuous(b_vf, rel_angles, fx = cos)
}
\arguments{
\item{b_vf}{Numeric denoting the slope of the utility function.}

\item{rel_angles}{Numeric vector containing the relative angle from each cell 
center to the predicted positions of the group members. Typically output of 
\code{\link[predped]{get_angle}}.}

\item{fx}{Trigonometric function applied to the relative angles defining what
their effect is (scaled by \code{b_vf}). Defaults to \code{cos}, saying that 
the maximal utility stems from directly looking at a person (orientation 0).
Alternative could be \code{sin}, which maximizes the utility of looking at 
a person from right next to them (orientation 90).}
}
\value{
Numeric vector containing the utility attributed to keeping the 
group members within your visual field. Returns 0's if the agent does not 
have any additional group members.
}
\description{
The idea of this utility function is to let the angle at which you see your 
group members play a role in the utility. Here, we distinguish between using 
a cosine for the maximization -- leading to maximum utility whenever an agent 
is directly looking at a group member and to minimum utility whenever the 
group member is directly behind the agent -- and the sine -- leading to 
maximum utility whenever the group members are directly besides the agent and 
to minimum utility whenever the agent is either directly behind the group 
member or the group member behind the agent.
