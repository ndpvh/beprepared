\title{Look for the best direction to head in}
\usage{
best_angle(
  agent,
  state,
  background,
  agent_specifications,
  velocities,
  orientations,
  step = 45,
  cpp = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{agent}{Object of the \code{\link[predped]{agent-class}}.}

\item{state}{Object of the \code{\link[predped]{state-class}}.}

\item{background}{Object of the \code{\link[predped]{background-class}}.}

\item{agent_specifications}{List containing the specifications of all agents
in the state. Is provided here as an argument to increase computational 
speed, as you only have to define these specifications once (instead of 
multiple times) per iteration. This list is furthermore needed to make the 
connection with the \code{m4ma} package.}

\item{velocities}{Numerical matrix that contains the change in velocity per 
cell that the agent might move to.}

\item{orientations}{Numerical matrix that contains the change in orientation 
per cell that the agent might move to.}

\item{step}{Numeric denoting the change in angle for looking around in 
degrees. Defaults to \code{45}, meaning that the agent looks around 
exhaustively in 8 different directions (360 / 45) by default.}
}
\value{
Numeric denoting the angle or direction that had the highest utility
(in degrees).
}
\description{
This functions scans the environment and computes the utility of each 
possible direction. Used in \code{\link[predped]{update_position}} when 
the agent has to reorient itself.
