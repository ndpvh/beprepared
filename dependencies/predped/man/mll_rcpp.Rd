\title{Compute the min-log-likelihood}
\usage{
mll_rcpp(data, parameters, ids, idx, cells, sizes, summed)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{List containing data.frames to use in the estimation procedure.}

\item{parameters}{List containing the parameters to be used.
Should be specified in the same order as specified in \code{"parameter_names"}.}

\item{ids}{CharacterVector containing the names of the participants in the 
data set.}

\item{idx}{IntegerVector containing the index of the parameters to use to 
evaluate a given row in the data. Note that this index uses C++ convention.
Order should conform to the order in the list of the data.}

\item{cells}{IntegerVector denoting the cell to which a participant has 
moved at a given iteration. Order should conform to the order in the list of 
the data.}

\item{sizes}{IntegerVector containing the number of data points per person.
Ignored if \code{summed} is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{summed}{Boolean denoting whether to sum the min-log-likelihood to one
value per person. If \code{TRUE}, you get the resulting summed 
min-log-likelihood for each individual with a correction to avoid \code{-Inf}s.
If \code{FALSE}, the function will instead return a list of vectors containing
the raw likelihoods (not min-log-likelihoods!), allowing users to specify 
their own corrections (if needed).}
}
\value{
Either named vector containing the summed min-log-likelihood 
(\code{summed = TRUE}) or named list with vectors of raw likelihoods
(\code{summed = FALSE}) per person in the dataset.
}
\description{
Rcpp alternative to \code{\link[predped]{mll}}. Be wary: This version does 
not automatically add the motion variables to the data if not present in 
the data, nor does it do any of the other preprocessing. It is therefore 
better not used as an alternative to the R version, but rather as an 
extension of it (as done automatically in predped).
