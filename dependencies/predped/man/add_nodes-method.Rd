\title{Add Nodes along the Outside or Inside of an Object}
\usage{
add_nodes(object, ...)

\S4method{add_nodes}{polygon}(object, space_between = 0.5, only_corners = FALSE, outside = TRUE)

\S4method{add_nodes}{circle}(object, space_between = 0.5, only_corners = FALSE, outside = TRUE)

\S4method{add_nodes}{segment}(object, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{Object of \code{\link[predped]{object-class}}.}

\item{space_between}{Numeric denoting the space to leave between the 
circumference of the object and the nodes to create. When \code{outside = TRUE},
\code{space_between} distance is created to the outside of the object, while
if \code{outside = FALSE} this same distance is created towards the inside 
of the object. Defaults to \code{0.5}.}

\item{only_corners}{Logical denoting whether to only add nodes at the corners 
of each object (\code{TRUE}) or to also add nodes between these newly created
corner-nodes (\code{FALSE}). When \code{only_corners = FALSE}, other nodes 
that are added have a distance of \code{space_between} between them. 
Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{outside}{Logical denoting whether the nodes should lie on the outside 
(\code{TRUE}) or inside (\code{FALSE}) of the object. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
Numerical matrix containing the nodes that were created around/within
the provided object.
}
\description{
Used in the \code{\link[predped]{create_nodes}} function for creating path-
points the agents can use to walk around objects. Currently works for all 
instances of \code{\link[predped]{object-class}}, but only returns 
\code{NULL} for the \code{\link[predped]{segment-class}}.
}
\details{
This method is related to the \code{\link[predped]{nodes_on_circumference-method}},
but differs in the respect that 
\code{\link[predped]{nodes_on_circumference-method}} adds nodes directly on the 
circumference of an object, while \code{add_nodes} adds nodes on the outside 
of inside of an object.

Please note that if \code{only_corners = TRUE} for the 
\code{\link[predped]{circle-class}}, that the nodes are chosen in such a way
that they are at a distance of \code{space_between} away from the 
circumference of the circle AND so that this node is connected to its 
neighbours through a tangential line to the circle. In agent-based terms, 
this means that if an agent stands at one of the nodes that are created, 
they can also see alternative nodes around the circle. If 
\code{only_corners = FALSE}, the general logic is used to determine where the 
other nodes should end up.

\examples{
# Create an object
my_circle <- circle(center = c(0, 0), radius = 1)

# Generate nodes that fall around this circle with a distance of 1 around 
# the circle
add_nodes(my_circle, space_between = 1)

# Note that for segments, this function returns NULL
my_segment <- segment(from = c(0, 0), to = c(2, 2))
add_nodes(my_segment)
