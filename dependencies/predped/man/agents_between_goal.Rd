\title{Find number of agents blocking agent}
\usage{
agents_between_goal(agent, state, agent_predictions = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{agent}{Object of the \code{\link[predped]{agent-class}}.}

\item{state}{Object of the \code{\link[predped]{state-class}}.}

\item{agent_predictions}{Matrix containing the predicted positions of all 
agents in the simulation, where the id's  of the agents serve as the 
rownames. Is typically handled under the hood. Defaults to \code{NULL}, 
triggering this function to consider where the other agents are right now 
(instead of where they will be in the next iteration).}
}
\value{
List containing all of the agents that are blocking the path
}
\description{
This function computes the number of other agents in a particular state who 
are blocking the way between the current agent and their goal. This is done 
so that the current agent can reevaluate whether they want to keep pursuing 
this way to their goal, or whether they want to reroute.

# Create an agent and a state
