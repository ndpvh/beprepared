\title{Transform data to a trace}
\usage{
to_trace(data, background, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Instance of a data.frame containing the data you want to transform.}

\item{background}{Instance of the \code{\link[predped]background-class} 
containing the setting in which the data were gathered.}

\item{...}{Arguments passed to \code{\link[predped]{add_cells}}.}
}
\description{
This function does the opposite of \code{\link[predped]{unpack_trace}}. It
takes in a data.frame and return a trace according to \code{predped}s 
requirements. The data.frame should at least have the column names "x", "y", 
"time", and "id", containing the coordinates, times at which the data were 
gathered (in seconds), and the id-number of the person whose data it is.
Additionally, data.frame needs information on the goals that agents were 
trying to achieve at each timepoint, of which their positions should be 
saved under "goal_x" and "goal_y", and their id to "goal_id".
