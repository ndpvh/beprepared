\description{
This parameter list contains the default mean parameters under slot 
\code{params_archetypes}, their standard deviations under slot 
\code{params_sigma}, and their bounds under \code{params_bounds}. These 
parameters automatically come with the package.

\details{
# Content of the slots

Values under slots \code{params_archetypes} and \code{params_sigma} contain 
some variation as imposed through what we call the "archetypes", which for 
\code{params_archetypes} can be found in the column \code{name} and for 
\code{params_sigma} in the names of this list. These archetypes represent 
parameter sets that have been created to display a given type of behavior, 
such as rushing to get to the goals ("Rushed") or making very random 
moment-to-moment decisions ("DrunkAussie"). These archetypes thus represent 
a part of the individual variability that \code{predped} allows.

Another aspect of this variability is controlled by the values under 
\code{params_sigma}. For each of the archetypes a covariance matrix is 
defined in the list \code{params_sigma} that allows for variation around the 
values found in \code{params_archetypes}. However, do not mistake the matrices
in \code{params_sigma} to be covariance matrices: Instead, these matrices 
have standard deviations on the diagonal and correlations between the 
parameters on the off-diagonal, allowing for users to more intuitively set 
up these matrices themselves. Under the hood, the covariance matrix COV is 
computed through the provided matrix X by defining:

\eqn{SD = diag(X) ,}

and by creating the matrix COR which consists of X with its diagonal turned 
to 1. We can then compute the covariance matrix by multplying both matrices:

\eqn{COV = COR * SD * SD^T .}

Importantly, the standard deviation and correlations should be defined between
each of the parameters. We furthermore note that the standard deviations can 
also be equal to 0, allowing no variation in the selected parameters.

# Parameters

Each of the parameters in \code{params_archetypes} controls an aspect of the 
decisions pedestrians make when walking around in an environment, namely:
\itemize{
    \item{\code{radius}:}{the radius of the agent}
    \item{\code{slowing_time}:}{the number of seconds the agent needs to slow
                               down when approaching a goal}
    \item{\code{preferred_speed}:}{the speed at which the agent is comfortable
                                  walking}
    \item{\code{randomness}:}{the temperature parameter that controls the 
                             overall unpredictability of the nex decision an 
                             agent will make. Larger values make movement 
                             more deterministic (i.e., strongly determined 
                             by the utility functions).}
    \item{\code{stop_utility}:}{utility value of stopping instead of moving}
    \item{\code{reroute}:}{number of pedestrians that should be in the way for
                          an agent to consider rerouting 50\% of the time}
    \item{\code{b_current_direction}:}{slope that scales the utility of 
                                      continuing waking in the current 
                                      direction}
    \item{\code{a_current_direction}:}{exponent that determines the power to 
                                      which the difference of not walking in 
                                      the current direction is taken}
    \item{\code{blr_current_direction}:}{scales the preference for walking to  
                                        the left or right when heading in a
                                        given direction. Done in such a way
                                        that \code{b_current_direction} 
                                        defines the slope for the left side 
                                        and is divided by 
                                        \code{blr_current_direction} for the 
                                        right side, meaning that the slope 
                                        for the right side increases when 
                                        \code{blr_current_direction < 1} and 
                                        decreases when 
                                        \code{blr_current_direction > 1}}
    \item{\code{b_goal_direction}:}{slope that scales the utility of heading

    \item{\code{a_goal_direction}:}{exponent that determines the power to

    \item{\code{a_blocked}:}{exponent that determines the power of the function

                                  a different social group, effectively 
                                  increasing the interpersonal distance}
