\title{Transform trace to comprehensive data.frame}
\usage{
unpack_trace_rcpp(
  trace,
  velocities,
  orientations,
  stay_stopped = TRUE,
  time_step = 0.5
)
}
\arguments{
\item{trace}{List of objects of the \code{\link[predped]{state-class}}}

\item{velocities}{Numeric matrix containing the change in speed for an agent
whenever they move to the respective cell of this matrix. Is used to create 
the cell positions that the agent might move to, as performed through 
\code{\link[m4ma]{c_vd_rcpp}}. Currently limited to having 11 rows (direction) 
and 3 columns (speed). Defaults to a matrix in which the columns contain 
\code{1.5} (acceleration), \code{1}, and \code{0.5}.}

\item{orientations}{Numeric matrix containing the change in direction for an 
agent whenever they move to the respective cell of this matrix. Is used to 
create the cell positions that the agent might move to, as performed through
\code{\link[m4ma]{c_vd_rcpp}}. Currently limited to having 11 rows (direction)
and 3 columns (speed). Defaults to a matrix in which the rows contain 
\code{72.5}, \code{50}, \code{32.5}, \code{20}, \code{10}, code{0}, \code{350}, 
\code{340}, \code{327.5}, \code{310}, \code{287.5} (note that the larger 
angles are actually the negative symmetric versions of the smaller angles).}

\item{stay_stopped}{Logical denoting whether agents will predict others that 
are currently not moving to remain immobile in the next iteration. Defaults 
to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{time_step}{Numeric denoting the time between each iteration. Defaults 
to \code{0.5} (the same as in \code{\link[predped]{simulate,predped-method}}).}

\description{
Rcpp alternative for the \code{\link[predped]{unpack_trace}} function.
}
\details{
This function will take a trace and return a data.frame containing all 
information contained within a typical time-series (cfr. 
\code{\link[predped]{time_series}}) and with all the input that should be 
provided to the utility functions. This is therefore the primary function to 
use if you want to go from a trace to a data.frame that can be used in 
M4MA-based estimations.
