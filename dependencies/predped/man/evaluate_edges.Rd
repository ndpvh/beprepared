\title{Evaluate whether edges pass through objects}
\usage{
evaluate_edges(segments, background, space_between)
}
\arguments{
\item{segments}{Named matrix or dataframe containing the ids of the nodes 
under column names \code{"from"} and \code{"to"}, and their coordinates under 
\code{"from_x"}, \code{"from_y"}, \code{"to_x"}, and \code{"to_y"}.}

\item{objects}{List of objects that extend the 
\code{\link[predped]{object-class}}.}
}
\value{
List containing a dataframe with the surviving connections between 
the nodes under \code{"edges"} and a similar dataframe also containing the 
coordinates under \code{"edges_with_coords"}.
}
\description{
This function evaluates whether the connections that are made between nodes 
are reachable, that is that the paths are not blocked by any objects. This 
also accounts for the one-way blockages that are present in the 
\code{limited_access} slot of the \code{\link[predped]{background-class}}.
}
\details{
In this function, a lot of the heavy lifting is done by the 
\code{\link[predped]{line_intersection}} method and the 
\code{\link[predped]{prune_edges}} function.

\examples{
# Let's create a background
my_background <- background(shape = rectangle(shape = c(0, 0), 
                                              size = c(2, 2)), 
                            objects = list(rectangle(shape = c(0, 0), 
                                                     size = c(1, 1))))

# Create some segments that do and do not go though the objects in the 
# background
potential_edges <- data.frame(from = c("node 1", "node 2", "node 3"), 
                              from_x = c(-0.75, -0.75, -0.75), 
                              from_y = c(0, 0, 0),
                              to = c("node 4", "node 5", "node 6"),
                              to_x = c(-0.75, 0.75, 0.95), 
                              to_y = c(0.75, 0, 0.95))
head(potential_edges)

# Only retain the edges that don't intersect the object
surviving_edges <- evaluate_edges(potential_edges, my_background)
head(surviving_edges$edges_with_coords)
