\title{An S4 Class to Represent the M4MA model.}
\description{
The \code{predped} class defines some of the settings that will be used when 
simulating data with the M4MA model. It contains the setting in which the 
agents should walk around as well as the parameters of those agents. At this 
moment, only supports the use of archetypes: Prototypical agents that have a 
given parameter set (see \code{\link[predped]{generate_parameters}} and 
\code{\link[predped]{params_from_csv}}).
}
\section{Slots}{

\describe{
\item{\code{id}}{Character that defines an identifier for the model.}

\item{\code{setting}}{Object of the \code{\link[predped]{background-class}}.}

\item{\code{parameters}}{Dataframe containing the parameters per archetype in its
columns.}

\item{\code{archetypes}}{Character or character vector containing the names of the 
archetypes that should be included in the simulation.}

\item{\code{weights}}{Numeric vector containing the probability with which an agent 
of each archetype can be selected to wander around in the environment. The 
weights should be in the same length as the \code{archetypes}-slot.}
