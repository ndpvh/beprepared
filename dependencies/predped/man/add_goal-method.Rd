\title{Add a goal to an object}
\usage{
add_goal(object, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{Object or instance of the \code{\link[predped]{object-class}}.}

\item{...}{Arguments passed on to \code{\link[predped]{rng_point-method}}}

\item{background}{Object of \code{\link[predped]{background-class}} containing
all objects in the environment that can have a goal attached to them in its 
\code{objects} slot.}

\item{id}{Character that serves as an identifier for the goal. Defaults to 
an empty character, triggering the random generation of an id.}

\item{counter}{Numeric denoting the number of time steps the agent should 
interact with the goal before the goal has been completed. Defaults to \code{5}.}
}
\value{
Object of \code{\link[predped]{goal-class}}.
}
\description{
Uses the characteristics of an object to add a goal to it.
}
\details{
Takes in an instance of \code{\link[predped]{object-class}} and uses its 
characteristics to generate an instance of \code{\link[predped]{goal-class}}
that is attached to it. In practice, uses one of the objects in the 
\code{objects} slot of a \code{\link[predped]{background-class}} instance. 

Is defined for all instances of \code{\link[predped]{object-class}} except for 
\code{\link[predped]{segment-class}}, which cannot contain goals due to its 
primary function.

\examples{
# Create a background
my_background <- background(shape = rectangle(center = c(0, 0), 
                                              size = c(2, 2)))

# Adjust the objects in the background for each of the different objects to 
# showcase how add_goals works for each
objects(my_background) <- list(circle(center = c(0, 0), radius = 0.5))
add_goal(my_background)

objects(my_background) <- list(rectangle(center = c(0, 0), size = c(1, 1)))
add_goal(my_background)

objects(my_background) <- list(polygon(points = cbind(c(0.5, 0.5, -0.5, -0.5), 
                                                      c(0.5, -0.5, -0.5, 0.5))))
add_goal(my_background)
