\title{Constructor for the \code{\link[predped]{goal-class}}}
\usage{
\S4method{initialize}{goal}(
  .Object,
  id = character(0),
  position = numeric(2),
  path = matrix(nrow = 0, ncol = 2),
  busy = FALSE,
  done = FALSE,
  counter = 5
)
}
\arguments{
\item{id}{Character that serves as an identifier for the goal. Defaults to 
an empty character, triggering the random generation of an id.}

\item{position}{Numerical vector denoting the position of the goal. Defaults 
to \code{c(0, 0)}.}

\item{path}{Numerical matrix of size n x 2 denoting the different intermediate
path points between an agent and a goal. In effect defines which path the 
agent will take to move towards the goal. Defaults to an empty matrix of size 
2 x 2.}

\item{busy}{Logical denoting whether the goal is currently being interacted 
with. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{done}{Logical denoting whether a goal has been completed. Defaults to 
\code{FALSE}.}

\item{counter}{Numeric denoting the number of time steps the agent should 
interact with the goal before the goal has been completed. Defaults to \code{5}.}
}
\value{
Object of the \code{\link[predped]{goal-class}}

\examples{
# Initialize agent
my_goal <- goal(id = "my goal", position = c(1, 1))

# Access the two slots that were specified
