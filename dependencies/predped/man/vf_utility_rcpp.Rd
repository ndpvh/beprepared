\title{Discrete visual field utility}
\usage{
vf_utility_rcpp(b_visual_field, relative_angles)
}
\arguments{
\item{b_vf}{Numeric denoting the slope of the utility function.}

\item{rel_angles}{Numeric vector containing the relative angle from each cell 
center to the predicted positions of the group members. Typically output of 
\code{\link[predped]{get_angle}}.}
}
\value{
Numeric vector containing the utility attributed to keeping the 
group members within your visual field. Returns 0's if the agent does not 
have any additional group members.
}
\description{
Rcpp alternative to the \code{vf_utility_discrete} function.
}
\details{
The idea of this utility function is that it doesn't matter at which angle 
you see a group member within the visual field, as long as you see them. 
This translates to a discrete added disutility whenever the group member 
falls inside the non-visual zone behind the agent.
