\title{Add motion variables to data}
\usage{
add_motion_variables(
  data,
  velocities = c(1.5, 1, 0.5),
  orientations = c(-72.5, -50, -32.5, -20, -10, 0, 10, 20, 32.5, 50, 72.5),
  time_step = 0.5,
  threshold = qnorm(0.975, 2 * 0.035, 4 * 0.035^4)/time_step
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Instance of a data.frame containing the data you want to transform.}

\item{velocities}{Numeric vector denoting the changes in speeds as assumed by 
the M4MA. Defaults to \code{1.5} (acceleration), \code{1}, and \code{0.5}.}

\item{orientations}{Numeric vector denoting the changes in orientation as 
assumed by the M4MA. Defaults to \code{72.5}, \code{50}, \code{32.5}, 
\code{20}, \code{10}, code{0}, \code{350}, \code{340}, \code{327.5}, 
\code{310}, \code{287.5} (note that the larger angles are actually the 
negative symmetric versions of the smaller angles).}

\item{time_step}{Numeric denoting the time between each iteration. Defaults 
to \code{0.5} (the same as in \code{\link[predped]{simulate,predped-method}}).}

\item{treshold}{Numeric denoting under which observed value for speed the 
cell to which an agent has moved should be put to `0`. Defaults to a value 
based on the observed measurement error in our system.}
}
\description{
This function adds several motion variables to an already existing dataset. 
These motion variables are then used by \code{predped} to compute utilities, 
allowing for estimations in the long run. The variables that are added are 
speed, orientation, and the cell to which a person moved (as defined by the
M4MA).
}
\details{
The provided dataset should at least have the following columns:
 - \code{x}, \code{y}: Coordinates at which a person was standing at a given 
   time
 - \code{time}: A continuous variable that denotes the time at which the 
   measurement took place.
 - \code{id}: The identifier given to the person whose position was measured.
 - \code{goal_id}: The identifier given to the goal the person had to move 
   towards while their position was being measured.
 - \code{goal_x}, \code{goal_y}: The position of the goal the person had to 
   move to while their position was being measured.
