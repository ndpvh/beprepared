\title{An S4 Class to Represent Agents.}
\description{
Defines the \code{agent} class, which contains all characteristics of an agent. 
Some of these characteristics are time-independent (e.g., parameters and 
set of goals) while others change during each time step in the simulation or 
estimation (e.g., speed and orientation).
}
\section{Slots}{

\describe{
\item{\code{id}}{Character that serves as an identifier for the agent.}

\item{\code{center}}{Numerical vector of two elements denoting the current position
of the agent (x and y coordinate).}

\item{\code{radius}}{Numeric denoting the size of agent. As agents are circular, this 
is equal to the radius of the agent.}

\item{\code{speed}}{Numeric denoting the current speed of the agent (in m/sec).}

\item{\code{orientation}}{Numeric denoting the orientation of the agent (in degrees)}

\item{\code{group}}{Numeric indicating the group to which the agent belongs. 
Influences the behavior of the agent through the social utility functions.}

\item{\code{status}}{Character denoting the current status of the agent, or what they
will be doing to make the next decision. Is one of "move" (the agent will 
move to another cell), "plan" (the agent will plan the route to their next 
goal), "reroute" (the agent will replan the route of their current goal), 
"reorient" (the agent will check other movement options), "completing goal"
(the agent will interact with their goal), "exit" (the agent will exit the 
space), or "wait" (the agent will wait for another agent to finish their goal 
and step out of the way).}

\item{\code{waiting_counter}}{Numeric defining how long the agent will remain in the 
status "wait" once triggered. At the start of the waiting period is set to be 
equal to the number of iterations the other agent still has to interact with 
their goal plus 2.}

\item{\code{cell}}{Numeric denoting the cell the agent will move to.}

\item{\code{current_goal}}{Object of class \code{\link[predped]{goal-class}} which
represents the current goal of the agent.}

\item{\code{goals}}{List of goals the agent has to achieve. The current goal is not 
included in this list.}

\item{\code{parameters}}{Dataframe containing the values of the parameters for the 
agent. Should contain all parameters relevant for the utility functions 
(use \code{predped::draw_parameters(1)} for an example).}

\item{\code{color}}{Character denoting the color in which the agent should be plotted.}
