\title{Generate multiple goal stacks}
\usage{
multiple_goal_stacks(
  n,
  setting,
  goal_number = function(x) rnorm(x, 10, 2),
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Integer denoting the number of goals to generate.}

\item{setting}{Object of \code{\link[predped]{background-class}}.}

\item{goal_number}{Numeric, vector, or function that defines the number of 
goals for each of the goal stacks that will be generated. When numeric, each 
goal stack will have the same number of goals equal to the value provided 
to this argument. When a numeric vector, the values of this vector will be 
iterated as values for the number of goals in the goal stacks. When a 
function, a random value for the number of goals for each goal stack counter 
will be generated through the function. For this to work, the function that is 
provided should take in the input \code{n} which defines the number of 
values to draw from the function. Defaults to \code{\(n) rnorm(n, 10, 2)}.}

\item{...}{Arguments provided to \code{\link[predped]{goal_stack}}.}
}
\value{
List of lists containing instances of the 
\code{\link[predped]{goal-class}}.
}
\description{
Use the defined setting to generate multiple stacks of random goals that 
each agent might have to complete. This function outputs a list of multiple 
lists with different instances of the \code{\link[predped]{goal-class}}.
}
\examples{
# Create a setting
my_background <- background(shape = rectangle(center = c(0, 0), 
                                              size = c(2, 2)), 
                            objects = list(cirlce(center = c(0, 0), 
                                                  radius = 0.5)))

# Create two goal stacks containing two goals each
goal_stack <- multiple_goal_stacks(2, my_background, goal_number = 2)

# Two goal stacks of two goals each
length(goal_stack)

length(goal_stack[[1]])
goal_stack[[1]]

length(goal_stack[[2]])
goal_stack[[2]]
