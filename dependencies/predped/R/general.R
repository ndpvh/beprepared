#' Determine iterated values from various arguments
#' 
#' @details
#' Takes in a numeric, numeric vector, or function and transforms this input to 
#' a numeric vector that contains values based on the input. When a numeric is 
#' provided, this function will output this same numeric repeated an
#' \code{iterations} number of times. Similarly, when a numeric vector is 
#' provided, this numeric vector will also be repeated an \code{iterations}
#' number of times. When a function is provided, \code{iterations} will be 
#' provided as an argument of this function.
#' 
#' This function is used to enhance the generalizability of how certain values 
#' are determined, and is used for determining:
#' \itemize{
#'    \item{}{the number of goals to simulate in each goal stack in the 
#'            \code{\link[predped]{multiple_goal_stacks}} function}
#'    \item{}{the counter for each goal in a goal stack in the 
#'            \code{\link[predped]{goal_stack}} function}
#'    \item{}{the number of agents that can maximally be in the simulation at 
#'            each time point in the \code{\link[predped]{simulate-predped-method}}}
#'    \item{}{the iteration number at which an agent can be added to the
#'            simulation in the \code{\link[predped]{simulate-predped-method}}}
#' }
#' 
#' Note that for this function to work, one should correctly define their 
#' own function when provided to the argument \code{x}. Specifically, this 
#' function should take in a single argument \code{n} which defines the number 
#' of values to generate. For example, a typical default for this function is 
#' \code{\(n) rnorm(n, 10, 2)}.
#' 
#' @param x Numeric, numerical vector, or function that should be used to 
#' generate the needed values.
#' @param iterations Integer denoting the number of values that should be 
#' generated.
#' @param positive_integer Logical denoting whether to make all drawn values 
#' positive integers. Defaults to \code{TRUE}, given the use-cases that it is 
#' currently used for.
#' 
#' @return Numeric vector containing values based on the input.

#' Raycasting algorithm
